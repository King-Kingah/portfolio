## Description

I had the opportunity to intern at **Safaricom**, which is the leading provider of converged communication solutions in Kenya. During my internship, I optimized the network and cloud infrastructure, which resulted in an increase in **telephony** and **broadband internet connectivity** to over twenty thousand subscribers. I also built and maintained a user-friendly web application, which demonstrated a service-oriented architecture and promoted a conducive work culture. In addition, I was responsible for managing and optimizing the day-to-day cellular network traffic, both voice and data. I was also exposed to emerging ISP technologies, such as **Narrowband IoT** and **SD-WAN**, which provided me with valuable hands-on experience in the telecommunications industry. Overall, my internship at Safaricom was a great learning experience and gave me insights into the world of telecommunications.
