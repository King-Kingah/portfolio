## Description

As a Network Technician at **Propel Net**, I was responsible for implementing LANs, WANs, intranets, extranets, and other data networks. I also performed network modeling and analysis to optimize new installations and existing client sites. In addition, I carried out network design, acquired equipment, and oversaw the installation and implementation of network deployment plans. This included evaluating and selecting hardware, software, and other components for the network.

Furthermore, I was tasked with developing an online platform for the company that would allow customers to pay their monthly internet charges, view their consumption, raise complaints, and get company contacts. To implement this platform, I used a technology stack that included **HTML, JavaScript, and APIs**, among others. This experience not only allowed me to apply my technical skills, but also helped me develop my project management and communication skills, as I worked closely with various teams within the company to ensure that the platform met the needs of our customers. Overall, my time at Propel Net provided me with valuable skills and knowledge in network engineering, deployment, and project management.
