## Description

As an intern at **Kenya Power and Lighting Company** (KPLC), I was responsible for configuring Cisco routers and switches, deploying microwave and P2P links, terminating, splicing and testing fiber optic cables, terminating Ethernet cables, and repairing and maintaining PCs. 

This experience provided me with valuable hands-on experience in network engineering and IT support that I can use in my future career.
